# Problem 1:
#
# Find a pair with a given sum.
#
# input: a list of integers l, an integer s
# return None if this sum doesn't exist in the array.
# output: a pair of numbers (a,b) where a,b are in l, and a + b == s
# findSum([1,3,5], 8) returns (3, 5)
# 
# What data structure did you use?

# Find the mode of a list of numbers.
# The mode of a list is the most commonly occurring number in the list.

# Problem 3:
#
# We talked about a ring buffer in class
# A ring buffer has four methods
# pushFront(x)
# pushBack(x)
# popFront()
# popBack()
#
# Your job is to implement these four methods.
# We can't just use the list append method to resize the ring buffer.
# we might have front and back in the middle of the buffer,
# and append only adds new space at the end.
# for that reason, you're going to have to copy
# the array over to a bigger one manually.
#
# I've provided a malloc function to allocate a new array.
# You need to copy the old array into the new one
# but be sure to keep elements in the correct position
#
# For example if we have the buffer :
#
#     v back
# [3, 4, 1, 2]
#        ^ front
#
# and we were to resize it, then the new buffer should be
#     v back
# [3, 4, None, None, None, None, 1, 2]
#                                ^ front
#    
# pushFront Running Time: 
# pushBack Running Time: 
# popFront Running Time: 
# popBack Running Time:
